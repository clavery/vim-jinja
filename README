NOTE: This fork changes the indent logic quite a bit. I created it to
work with my particular set of plugins. It may not work for you.

Jinja for Vim
-------------

Jinja for Vim.  This is the updated version unlike the
one on vimscripts.

Features
--------

- Syntax highlighting
- Automatic detection of Jinja HTML templates that plays well
  with Django and other HTML files.
- Indent support

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
pathogen.vim, and then simply copy and paste:

   cd ~/.vim/bundle
   git clone git://github.com/mitsuhiko/vim-jinja.git

Configuration
-------------

  g:htmljinja_disable_detection (Default: 0)
    If set the plugin will not try to autodetect HTML files that
    contain Jinja code.

  g:htmljinja_disable_html_upgrade (Default: 0)
    If set the plugin will not try to check on each write of an HTML
    file it it should upgrade to htmljinja
